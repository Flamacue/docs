  title: What is Cloud Engineering?
  text: |
    Cloud Engineering can be simply defined as the apply the practices of software engineering to
    cloud computing, but in reality it is a much more complex discipline and category than that simple
    definition. The cloud gives you boundless opportunites to innovate but with those opportunites comes
    add complexity. In many ways the cloud is world's biggest super computer and Cloud Engineers, like yourself,
    are tasked with understanding and building on top of these massive systems. The cloud has pushed teams to
    move in the direction of distributed applications with modern archietectures enabling teams to go form
    ideation to delivering customer value faster and with more accuracy than ever before. We've entered a new era
    of software development where you're not writing client server applications like you did 20, 15, 10,
    even 5 years ago, all software is cloud software.

    As we enter this new era of software development we must not only look to the future but also remember our past
    and understand where we are today. Not everyone or every team is at the same place in their cloud engineering
    journey and our tooling must flexible enough to meet an ever changing set of demands. Some of us are already
    writing cloud native applications and need modern tooling to abstract away boilerplate code and easier collaboration
    amongst our peers. Others of us are running legacy applications that you want to modernize to take advantage of all
    the capabilities the cloud provides you. Cloud Engineering meets you where you are today while providing a clear
    path to a cloud native future.


essentials:
  - title: Customer Focus
    description: |
      At its core Cloud Engineering is about going from ideation to delivering customer value faster and with higher accuracy. At every step of the process we need to keep our customer needs as our top priority to ensure our applications and services are serving their needs faster and better than ever before.

  - title: Security
    description: |
      As you move towards a Cloud Engineering future, security needs to be a fundamental part of how you develop your software. Include validation and enforcement in your workflows to ensure that you're not making mistakes unknowingly. For example, opening ports to the internet that you didn't mean to, or creating S3 buckets that are unprotected.
